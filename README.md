# ChatTheDoc
ChatTheDoc implments AI logic to make users interact to their pdf files and get information without opening and reading them - just by asking in a chat. 
The implmentation has a blazor based UI with python implmentation of the AI logic to interact with OpenAi's Chat GPT.

# Deployment
Deploying a Blazor project to another machine involves a series of steps. I'll guide you through the process step by step, including cleaning up unnecessary files.

### Step 1: Build the Blazor Server and Client Project

1. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal**:
   - Navigate to the root directory of your Blazor project.

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Use the following command to build the project:
     ```
     dotnet build -c Release
     ```
   - This will compile the project in Release mode, optimizing it for deployment.

### Step 2: Publish the Blazor App

1. **Publish the App**:
   - Use the following command to publish the app:
     ```
     dotnet publish -c Release -o publish
     ```
   - This will publish the app to a folder named `publish`.

### Step 3: Prepare for Deployment

1. **Cleanup Unnecessary Files**:
   - Inside the `publish` folder, you can remove unnecessary files, such as `.pdb` (debug symbols) and `.runtimeconfig.json` files if they are present.

2. **Copy Required Files**:
   - Ensure you have the following files in the `publish` folder:
     - Your compiled application files.
     - The `wwwroot` folder (contains static content like CSS, JS, and images).
     - The `.dll` files.
     - The `.exe` file (if applicable).
     - The `.deps.json` and `.runtimeconfig.json` files (if applicable).

### Step 4: Transfer to Hosting Machine

1. **Transfer Files**:
   - Use a method like FTP, SCP, or any other file transfer protocol to move the `publish` folder to the target machine.

### Step 5: Set Up Hosting Environment

1. **Install .NET Runtime**:
   - Ensure that the .NET runtime matching your project version is installed on the hosting machine.

2. **Configure Web Server**:
   - If you're using a web server like IIS, set up a new site and point it to the folder containing your published Blazor app.

### Step 6: Start the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the application using the appropriate method for the web server you're using.

### Optional Steps:

1. **Secure Your Application**:
   - If your application handles sensitive information, consider setting up HTTPS and other security measures.

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Set up monitoring and regular maintenance tasks to ensure your application runs smoothly.

Remember that these steps are a general guideline. Depending on your specific environment, you might encounter variations or additional considerations. Always refer to the documentation of the specific tools or platforms you're using for detailed instructions.
